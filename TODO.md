Note:
doc about how consecutive spaces work
doc escaping
doc quotes and block quotes
doc sequences of {${ and }$} and the contents therin will be removed

todo:
would like to be able to tab align block quotes and have it parse as a steady string
found a bug when doing a vertical list and having a horizontal list as one of its members
